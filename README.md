# Module 9B - Custom Profile Component

## Description
This is a React app built with Vite. It contains a profile component styled with inline CSS, using passed props and UseState() for a hover effect.

## What I Learned
- How to use JSX to pass props
- How to style with inline CSS with a hover effect
- How to create and render functional components

## Challenges
Briefly describe any issues you encountered and how you resolved them.

When I added a div for hidden content that shows when the user mouses over, the component stopped showing in the web page until I saw that I forgot to add a closing div tag. Adding that fixed it. Also, at one point the page said the server wasn't responding. I don't know why the vite server shut down, but restarting it solved the problem.

## Screenshot
Include a screenshot of your component.
